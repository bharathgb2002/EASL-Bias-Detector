# EASL-LLM Bias Detector
A hybrid Machine Learning + Rule-based system to identify, classify and visualise bias in Large Language Model (LLM) responses.

This project was developed as part of CSE5PM — Assessment 3 at La Trobe University (Team: *6 Prime*).

---

## Project Overview
Reducing biases in AI systems is critical to ensure fairness and trust.  
Our project builds an Extended Active Selection Loop (EASL) that:
1) Collects prompts
2) Generates model responses
3) Human-annotates & labels bias
4) Trains a hybrid AI + rules classifier
5) Visualises patterns in bias

This tool can evaluate multiple LLMs and compare their bias profiles.

## Features
✔ Multi-label bias classification  
✔ Binary flag — *Biased / Not biased*  
✔ Supports rule-based + ML hybrid prediction  
✔ Human-verified annotation integration  
✔ Country, category + severity logging  
✔ Gradio UI for easy interaction  
✔ Supports CSV upload + saving new logs  
✔ Extensible framework to test ANY LLM

## Future Work

Plans for improvement include:
1) Expand labelled dataset for better generalisation
2) Experiment with additional classifiers
3) Explore transformer embeddings (e.g., SBERT)
4) Build larger keyword dictionary
5) Improve country-wise data balance
6) Multi-annotator agreement integration
7) Improve linguistic rule-based patterns and contextual cues
